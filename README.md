# MyJourney 2 Flip
After several years working for UNiQUARE, which is a great software development company it was time to try something new.
Luckily I saw the chance given by Corona and Flip found me.

A brief description of my journey switching from Java to Kotlin which I started because it's time to change my employer and start an adventure.

# My (personal) Setup
- Dell Notebook
- not much time
- IntelliJ IDEA
- a lot of motivation

After the Kotlin Koans I extended my personal setup with the following:
- Windows WSL with the current Ubuntu version
- [SDK Man](https://sdkman.io/)
- [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)

To be honest, there still seems to be a little bit of configuration problems, which I will investigate further so that I soon can start with my Kotlin/Micronaut project.

# My first guides to Kotlin
## Kotlin Lang
Naturally I typed "Kotlin" into google and found the homepage [Kotlin Lang](https://kotlinlang.org).   
After reading some lines I installed the recommended IDE IntelliJ IDEA and found the "Kotlin Koans" which I use to start the journey.

Since I am a developer who loves good documentation (I know this is rare), I started to read since I want to know the theory behind Kotlin also.

## Youtube
I also found the (Kotlin Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcFY9NSgXkk&list=PLNmsVeXQZj7rylgyThgUldHG8KE6Nbc1O] channel on Youtube.  
A nice channel which is in German which means I do not have to listen to an indian guy talking the indian version of english. (note: I am not against indian people, but with time for me personally it's to exhausting listening to them, because it's quite hard to understand)
