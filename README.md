# MyJourney 2 Flip
After several years working for UNiQUARE, which is a great software development company it was time to try something new.
Luckily I saw the chance given by Corona and Flip found me. More is coming soon ... stay tuned!

# My (personal) Setup
- Dell Notebook (Inspiron 7786)
- not much time 'cause I have a job, child, girlfriend and I am building a house
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (not the most actual because plugins won't work everytime with the newest)
- a lot of motivation because I love it when something new is happening.

## The story (all the up and downs)
With a lot of motivation I tried to think of an example project which would make sense to implement
and where I would be able to use a setup which is quite similar to the one I will use at my future job.

After the Kotlin Koans I extended my personal setup with the following:
- Windows WSL with the current Ubuntu version
- [SDK Man](https://sdkman.io/)
- [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)

There were some configuration problems, but a reboot helped a lot and so I am able to continue.

First, I installed and configured *git*.
I connected my local repository with the one in github.
GitHub (my last push was some years ago) changed to SSH only and so I had to create a key for Windows and Ubuntu.

Connection via SSH to GitHub is now established and I can begin to create branches for my features.
I executed the command for the micronaut project setup with kotlin and gradle and I now have the basis of my project created.

I think that additional to that project I will launch some experimental "projects" just to try some things out.

Update after a longer period of time, because I made some vacations to get my head free for the new journey.
In the meantime I finished the course "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" but I will rewatch the lessons again soon.

The other 2 courses will be skipped first because they focus solely on android and I am more interested in micronaut.
I found another course from predic8 and since I think that these guys are pretty good, I will do that one first (see link below)

But to be honest I have to get my docker setup running first, to be able to complete the predic8 course. 

### The Google Kotlin Course
After additional research I found the following courses:
- [Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9011)

### predic8
- [Micronaut Microservices](https://www.predic8.de/micronaut-microservices-video.htm)

### Baeldung
Since Baeldung is always a good idea to try out, I will write the clean architecture example in kotlin with gradle
https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-clean-architecture

### docker
- [Docker tutorial](http://localhost/tutorial/our-application/): To reach it execute: D:\Arbeit\IdeaProjects\MyJourney2Flip\docker-app>docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

# Helpful links and documentation
## Hexagonal architecture

## Kotlin Lang
Naturally I typed "Kotlin" into google and found the homepage [Kotlin Lang](https://kotlinlang.org).   
After reading some lines I installed the recommended IDE IntelliJ IDEA and found the "Kotlin Koans" which I use to start the journey.

Since I am a developer who loves good documentation (I know this is rare), I started to read since I want to know the theory behind Kotlin also.

### Youtube
I also found the (Kotlin Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcFY9NSgXkk&list=PLNmsVeXQZj7rylgyThgUldHG8KE6Nbc1O] channel on Youtube.  
A nice channel which is in German which means I do not have to listen to an indian guy talking the indian version of english. (note: I am not against indian people, but with time for me personally it's to exhausting listening to them, because it's quite hard to understand)
