# MyJourney2Kotlin
A brief description of my journey switching from Java to Kotlin which I started because it's time to change my employer and start an adventure.

# My (personal) Setup
- Dell Notebook
- not much time
- IntelliJ IDEA
- a lot of motivation

# My first guides to Kotlin
## Kotlin Lang
Naturally I typed "Kotlin" into google and found the homepage [Kotlin Lang](https://kotlinlang.org).   
After reading some lines I installed the recommended IDE IntelliJ IDEA and found the "Kotlin Koans" which I use to start the journey.

Since I am a developer who loves good documentation (I know this is rare), I started to read since I want to know the theory behind Kotlin also.

## Youtube
I also found the (Kotlin Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcFY9NSgXkk&list=PLNmsVeXQZj7rylgyThgUldHG8KE6Nbc1O] channel on Youtube.  
A nice channel which is in German which means I do not have to listen to an indian guy talking the indian version of english. (note: I am not against indian people, but with time for me personally it's to exhausting listening to them, because it's quite hard to understand)
